SCHAAL ROCKS WEB APP
=============================

I wanted to create an integration between a modern web audio player and a webGL abstraction library like Three.js

The goal is for the site to be fun to use. If space becomes available, for users to upload their own loops even. Eventually create timing capabilities, and visualize the track based on audio length and intensity.
