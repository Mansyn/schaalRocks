# Rocks Web App

I wanted to create an integration between a modern web audio player and a webGL abstraction library like Three.js

The goal is for the site to be fun to use. If space becomes available, for users to upload their own loops even. Eventually create timing capabilities, and visualize the track based on audio length and intensity.

It is currently being hosted at https://schaal.rocks

## Deployment

Being hosted on firebase

## Built With

* [howler.js](https://howlerjs.com/) - audio library for the modern web
* [three.js](https://threejs.org/) - create an easy to use, lightweight, 3D library with a default WebGL renderer
